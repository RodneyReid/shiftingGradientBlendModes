# Shifting Gradient Blend Modes "Loader"

This is a small, viewport aware, image-less loading/please wait animation,
which uses two moving radial gradients, and css3 blend-mode "color-burn" blending
to achieve an effect (which I believe) hasn't been done before on the web.
  
It's also pleasing to look at.
